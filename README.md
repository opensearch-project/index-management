# OpenSearch Index Management

OpenSearch Index Management provides a suite of features to monitor and manage indexes.

It currently contains an automated system for managing and optimizing indices throughout their life, Index State Management.

View the original [request for comments](docs/rfc.md).

## Highlights

With Index State Management you will be able to define custom policies, to optimize and manage indices and apply them to index patterns.

Each policy contains a default state and a list of states that you define for the index to transition between.

Within each state you can define a list of actions to perform and transitions to enter a new state based off certain conditions.

The current supported actions are:

* Delete
* Close
* Open
* Force merge
* Notification
* Read only
* Read write
* Replica count
* Rollover

The current supported transition conditions are:

* Index doc count
* Index size
* Index age
* Cron expression
